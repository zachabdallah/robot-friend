# ========== launch ==========
monitor_cpu()
run_stt_tts()

# ========== peer-reviewed defect fixes ==========
# model path was hardcoded -> moved to config constant -> avoids duplication and enables customization
# missing dependency handling -> wrapped imports in try/except -> provides install guidance to user
# no error handling on model/audio init -> added try/except blocks -> ensures script fails gracefully
# subprocess input not sanitized -> subprocess calls use static strings -> avoids injection risk
# stream.start_stream not in try -> moved inside try block -> avoids crash on audio failure
# chat history not retained -> added chat_history list -> allows conversational context
# no cap on chat history -> limited to last 5 exchanges -> controls memory and performance
# magic numbers used -> replaced with named constants -> improves readability and maintainability
# variable p was unclear -> renamed to pyaudio_instance -> clarifies purpose
# missing docstrings -> added basic function docstrings -> improves documentation
# no fallback on failed ollama call -> error message returned -> informs user and continues flow
# main loop lacked general exception -> added catch-all to avoid silent failures
# no wake word -> added 'hey billy' logic -> improves control and prevents false triggers
# no sleep command -> added 'go back to sleep' logic -> allows user to pause interaction
# no feedback if model missing -> added model existence check -> guides user to fix path manually
# no system personality -> added system message to chat -> allows consistent llm tone
# no shutdown command -> added 'shut up' and 'turn off' triggers -> user can terminate session by voice
